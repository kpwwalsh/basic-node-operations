Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.
```
Sort alphabetizes a file line by line.  The fs read command returns the first letter of the first word of each new line by '\n' and then reorganizes them in a new array via the split and join commands.

wc counts the newlines, bytes and words contained in a file.  That is what was collected in the terminal by way of scanning through the buffer counting end of line(\n)characters.

uniq returns unique lines sorted to check and remove duplicates using split and slice methods.  const commands = require("./commands.js"); was returned.

```
Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.
```
cat command.js|less to scroll up and down the file.

cat command.js|grep "slice" to return items with the key word "slice".

```
6)Use split, forEach(), push(), reverse(), and join(), to write a function that reverses 'Hello World'.
```
let reverseString=(inputString) =>{
let splitString=inputString.split("");
let pushArray=[];
   splitString.forEach((element) => {
     pushArray.push(element);
});
     pushArray.reverse("");
let reverseString= pushArray.join("");
  return reverseString;
};

reverseString("Hello World");


```
